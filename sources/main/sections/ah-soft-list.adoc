== Soft List

Soft List of NAVWARN general types to detail types cross mapping. The aids to
navigation section has sub sections, due to its length. These sub sections do not
appear in the data model. Those general sections that do not have any details
listings stand by themselves and can only be amplified by using the text attributes
in the complex attribute *warningInformation*.

The Soft List is not a normative grouping, and is intended to help implementors of
the S-124 Product Specification with grouping the large number of NAVWARN types. The
list is meant as a recommended mapping between the various general types and the
various detailed types. For example, an operator could be presented with the general
types and through an interface be given only the detailed types that this Soft List
has mapped to that general type. This represents a filtering of choices down to what
is considered most logical from a general type to the detailed type.
