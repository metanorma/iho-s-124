== Feature Catalogue

=== Introduction

The Feature Catalogue describes the feature types, information types, attributes,
attribute values, associations and roles which may be used in the product. The S-124
Feature Catalogue is available in an XML document which conforms to the S-100 XML
Feature Catalogue Schema and can be downloaded from the IHO Geospatial Information
Registry website (https://registry.iho.int/). Simple attributes used in this
specification are listed in <<tab-5-1>>.

=== Feature Types

Feature types contain descriptive attributes that characterize real-world entities.
The word 'feature' may be used in one of two senses -- feature type and feature
instance. A feature type is a class and is defined in a Feature Catalogue. A feature
instance is a single occurrence of the feature type and represented as an object in a
dataset. A feature instance is located by a relationship to one or more spatial
instances. A feature instance may exist without referencing a spatial instance.

==== Geographic

Geographic (geo) feature types carry the descriptive characteristics of a real-world
entity (a location or place on the surface of the Earth). In the context of
hydrographic products, this includes the adjacent regions from the sea floor to
elevations of landforms and structures above the Earth's surface.

==== Cartographic

Cartographic features contain information about the cartographic representation
(including text) of real-world entities.

==== Information Types

Information types define identifiable pieces of information in a dataset that can be
shared using information associations. They have attributes but have no geometry.

=== Feature and information relationships

A feature relationship links instances of one feature type with instances of the same
or a different feature type.

An information relationship links instances of feature types or information types to
instances of information types.

=== Attributes

S-124 defines attributes as either simple or complex.

==== Simple Attributes

S-124 uses ten types of simple attributes; they are listed in the following table:

[[tab-5-1]]
.Simple feature attributes
[cols="a,a",options=header]
|===
| Type | Definition

| Boolean
| A value representing binary logic. The value can be either true or false.

| Enumeration
| One of a list of predefined values

| Integer (int)
| An integer number

| Text or CharacterString
| An arbitrary-length sequence of characters including accents and special characters from a repertoire of one of the adopted character sets

| Date
| A date gives values for year, month and day according to the Gregorian Calendar. Character encoding of a date is a string which shall follow the calendar date format (complete representation, basic format) for date specified by <<ISO8601>>.

[example]
19980918 (YYYYMMDD)

In XML formats, the XML Schema standard type should be used instead of the <<ISO8601>> basic representation (which is not a standard type in XML).

[example]
1998-09-18

NOTE: Since S-124 uses XML formats for both datasets and metadata, the XML encoding must be used.

| Time
| A 24-hour time, it may contain a time zone. In XML formats the XML Schema standard type should be used instead of the <<ISO8601>> basic representation (which is not a standard type in XML).

[example]
====
18:30:59Z (time in UTC);

18:30:59+01:00 (local time with given offset);

18:30:59 (local time without an offset to UTC).
====

NOTE: Since S-124 uses XML formats for both datasets and metadata, the XML encoding must be used.

| Date and Time

| A DateTime is a combination of a date and a time type. Character encoding of a DateTime shall follow <<ISO8601>> (see above). The "T" is a separator indicating that time-of-day follows.

[example]
19850412T101530 (YYYMMDDThhmmss)

In XML formats, the XML Schema standard type should be used instead of the <<ISO8601>> basic representation (which is not a standard type in XML).

[example]
1985-04-12T10:15:30; 1985-04-12T10:15:30+01:00;1985-04-12T10:15:30Z

NOTE: Since S-124 uses XML formats for both datasets and metadata, the XML encoding must be used.

| Codelist
| A type of flexible enumeration. A code list type is a list of literals which may be extended only in conformance with specified rules.

| Truncated date
| An S100_TruncatedDate allows a date or partial date to be given. At least one of the year/month/day components must be present. Since S-124 uses XML formats for both dataset and metadata, the XML encoding (XML type *gMonthDay*) of truncated dates must be used (i.e., the <<ISO8601>> basic format is not used in S-124).

Components:

YYYY Year integer between 0000 and 9999

MM Month integer between 01 -- 12 (inclusive)

DD Day integer between 01 and 28, 29, 30, or 31 (inclusive), consistent with year and month values if these are specified

*gMonthDay* is a Gregorian date that recurs, specifically a day of the year such as the third of May. Arbitrary recurring dates are not supported by this datatype. The value space of *gMonthDay* is the set of calendar dates, as defined in <<ISO8601,section=3>>. Specifically, it is a set of one-day long, annually periodic instances.This type can be used to encode recurring instants (see <<S100,clause="3-8">>). The appropriate XML Schema type should be used. The "g" indicates a Gregorian date is utilized.

[example]
--12-17 representing 17 December of any year (conforming to the XML type *gMonthDay*)

<<S100,part=10b>> provides further details about encoding in GML datasets.

| URN
| A persistent, location-independent, resource identifier that follows thesyntax and semantics for URNs specified in RFC 2141.

[example]
urn:mrn:iho:hydro:js:AnchorageArea01
|===

NOTE: the use of URN in S-124 must utilize the schema of the Maritime Resource Name
(MRN) concept.

[[cls-5.4.2]]
==== Complex Attributes

Complex attributes are aggregations of other attributes that are either simple or
complex. The aggregation is defined by means of attribute bindings.

=== Units of Measure

There is no use of a specific unit of measure in the S-124 data model. However, the
content of text attributes that describe the nature of navigational warnings should
make use of the following units of measure where appropriate:

* Orientation is given in decimal degrees.
* Radio frequency is given in hertz.
* Uncertainty is given in metres.
* Horizontal distance is given in either metres (m) or kilometres (km) or nautical
miles (NM), as indicated by the designation.
* Depths are given in metres.
* Heights are given in metres.

[[cls-5.6]]
=== Geometric Representation

Geometric representation is the digital description of the spatial component of an
object as described in <<S100,part=7>> and <<ISO19107>>. This product specification
uses three types of geometries: *GM_Point*, *GM_OrientableCurve*, and
*GM_OrientableSurface*. *point, curve and surface.*

Spatial uncertainties can be encoded using the complex attribute *spatialAccuracy*.
For values expressed quantitatively the *horizontalPositionAccuracy* sub-complex
attribute must be used, or qualitatively expressed values are captured using the
*qualityOfHorizontalMeasurement* enumerated list. This modelling of spatial
uncertainties align with that of S-101 ENCs.
