[[cls-12.1]]
=== Introduction

The S-124 metadata description is a subset of the metadata described in
<<S100,part=17>>, which is a profile of the <<ISO19115>> standard. The S-124 metadata
model restricts the <<S100>> metadata model to its core elements;
S100_ExchangeCatalogue, S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata,
S100_CatalogueDiscoveryMetadata and S100_SupportFileDiscoveryMetadata. Moreover, the
S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata is further restricted to remove attributes that are not
relevant to a Navigational Warning service. <<fig-13-1>> below shows the details of
the S-124 metadata model and the details are further explained in the tables in the
subsequent sections.

=== Exchange Set Catalogue and Dataset metadata

The tables in this section provide a detailed textual description of the encoding of
the S-124 Exchange Set Catalogue.

[underline]#S100_ExchangeCatalogue# -- Exchange Set metadata contains metadata about
the contents of the Exchange Set and metadata about the data distributor.

[underline]#S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata# -- Dataset metadata describe information
about a dataset. It facilitates the management and exploitation of data and is an
important requirement for understanding the characteristics of a dataset. Discovery
metadata can help users determine whether a product or service is fit for purpose and
from where these have been obtained.

[underline]#S100_CatalogueDiscoveryMetadata# -- Catalogue metadata assists in
distributing feature and portrayal catalogues for the proper reading and portrayal of
S-124 datasets.

[underline]#S100_SupportFileDiscoveryMetadata# -- Support file metadata describe
information about a data resource. It facilitates the management and exploitation of
data and is an important requirement for understanding the characteristics of a data
resource. In S-124 only language packs are considered support files.

==== S100_ExchangeCatalogue

Each Exchange Set has a single S100_ExchangeCatalogue which contains meta information
for the data and support files in the Exchange Set.
