== Data Capture and Classification

S-124 products are the result of the official production agency process. S-124
products must be based on data sources deemed reliable by the production agency. The
Data Classification and Encoding Guide (DCEG) describes how data describing a
Navigational Warning should be captured using the types defined in the S-124 Feature
Catalogue, and is found in Appendix A. General principles for Navigational Warnings
according to WWNWS, such as how to administer a NAVAREA, what constitute a sub area
warning and coastal warning are found in <<S53>> - Joint IHO/IMO/WMO Manual on
Maritime Safety Information (MSI). Local warnings are outside of scope of <<S53>>,
and will be defined in national or local documentation.
